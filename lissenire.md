title: Lissenire
---
# Lissenire is a homebrew Dungeons & Dragons campaign.

## Background
Just as welkin magic comes from above, bestowed by the gods, so does profane magic rise up from below. It is in the soil and rock; drawn up by the roots of plants or concentrated in precious stones. As the dwarves delve deeper and the forests grow tall, more of the profane comes to the surface.

Two hundred years of peace are drawing to an end. After [[King Pellam’s Drown]], the great flood, the beasts of the wild were scarcely seen in the Lissenire Valley — but now the days are growing darker, and the wilderness has begun to reclaim its old lands. The new King Brenin’s defences are stretched thin; of late it has been common for nobles and wealthier merchants to take matters into their own hands. The roads are dangerous.

Everyday folk, people of the villages and hamlets of Lissenire, turn to the Church or appeal to one of the Four Lords for assistance, though their requests are rarely met. The most desperate settlements have been known to make pacts with the dwarrowfolk of Mull Galudden, or to send out for adventurers and champions errant.

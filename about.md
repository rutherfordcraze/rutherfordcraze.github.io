## About Me

Hi, I’m Rutherford. Originally from the UK, currently based in The Hague, Netherlands. I’m a designer and developer primarily focused on type — in 2020, I founded [Mass‑Driver](https://mass-driver.com), a studio for typeface design and font production.

## About the Site

This site is a personal space for thoughts, side projects, and general reference. It’s part blog, part wiki, part digital garden. On a technical level, it’s designed to be minimal and accessible — it uses mostly semantic <abbr>HTML</abbr> with no JavaScript, and still works with <abbr>CSS</abbr> disabled.

`Monospaced text` on this site is set in MD IO, and the rest is MD Lórien. Both typefaces are my own work — they’re available from [my studio site](https://mass-driver.com).

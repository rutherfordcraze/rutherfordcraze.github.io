## As of August 9, 2024

After a trip to visit family in the UK, I’m back home and looking forward to a quiet rest of the summer. After publishing [MD Lórien](https://mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-lorien) in June, I’m in need of a bit of time off.

## Longer-term

I’m still based in The Hague (since 2020), and still very happily working on typefaces for my studio, [Mass-Driver](https://mass-driver.com). In my spare time I’m learning the basics of cabinet making.

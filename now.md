## As of June 16, 2024

I’ve just published [MD Lórien](https://mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-lorien), my first commercially-available serif typeface. I started drawing it in July of 2022 — it’s taken almost two years (and the help of two other designers) to complete. But I’m very happy with it!

As the weather gets better, I’ve been starting to work on a balcony garden. I have a pretty good track record with [houseplants](/houseplants), but this is my first time gardening outdoors. (Not counting the two ferns I killed last summer.)

## Longer-term

I’m still based in The Hague (since 2020), and still very happily working on typefaces for my studio, [Mass-Driver](https://mass-driver.com). In my spare time I’m working on bicycle maintenance and learning the basics of cabinet making.

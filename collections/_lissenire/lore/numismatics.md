## The Oserian Empire
The most basic unit of Oserian currency is the **Grain,** a small copper coin. Equivalent to a bushel of wheat or half a loaf of bread, most day-to-day business is exchanged in grains.

A **Nail** is a silver-plated coin worth ten grains, and is the daily charge of most simple labourers. It’ll fetch a simple room in a cheap inn, or a good meal.

A golden **Crown** is worth ten nails, or a hundred grains, and will buy a goat or a quiver’s worth of arrows.

The most valuable Oserian coin is the **Empire,** worth ten crowns apiece. A modest weapon or a set of leather armour costs about one empire, though usually the white-gold coins themselves are kept under lock and key; actual commerce uses crowns and nails.

## The Dwarrowlands
Dwarrow coins take two forms, the simplest of which is the **Link.** A small bronze coin shaped like a link of chainmail, with carvings and notches around the band, and a small gap where two or more links can be joined together. One dwarrowlink is worth about five Oserian grains.

The dwarrow **Shield** is the more valuable of the mountain coins, a copper-like (but heavy) coin worth around five Oserian crowns. In werren settlements near Mull Galudden, dwarrowshields are valued more highly, and may be used in place of empires.

## The Medhars
Though no longer used as legal tender, some Medhar coins still survive, and are sometimes bartered with. **Splints,** or splint-coins, are the crudest and smallest of these, worth about an Oserian grain each.

**Axes** are larger, bronze coins stamped with a crude image of a war-axe on one side. They’re typically worth about a nail.

Finally, **Wheels** (named for the image of a cart or chariot wheel they bear) are the most valuable, if for no reason other than their scrap value. The right merchant will pay five or six nails for one.

## The Lei Mara
Not much is known about the coins of the Lei Mara, but their age grants them a certain value independent of their material worth. Merchants know they can be sold to sages for a good price.

Lei Mara coins are made from differently-shaped metail, each with a hole punched through the centre (which was used to attach several together with a string). **Square** coins are the most common, and least valuable, fetching about the same as an Oserian grain or a Medhar splint.

**Circles** are slightly rarer, and worth around one Oserian nail.

**Ovals** are rarer still, fetching a gold crown each from the right buyer.

**Hexagons** are the rarest of the Lei Mara coins, with each fetching at least an empire or two dwarrowshields.

title: Riec-D’nar
=====
In the time before the Making of the World, there was nothing. But at once, there was Riec-D’nar: both the real and the reflection; the light and the darkness; the abyss made form.

Riec-D’nar created [[Muen]] and the first [[Gods]], on our side of [[The Divide]]. On the other, she made reflections of them, the nature of which is not known.

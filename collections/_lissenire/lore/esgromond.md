> You pray to your gods. We have seen ours. Deep beneath the living earth, she sleeps in sunfire.

Esgromond — the Fire that Feasts; the Lava Below — is the dwarrow-god, the personification of the magma which lies beneath all the world. Under the mountain, it is believed that at the end of all days, Esgromond will rise up to consume everything.

[[Dwarrowfolk]] offer gifts to Esgromond, as well as giving their dead to her _endless warm embrace._ Interpretations vary as to whether these offerings are out of respect, or as tokens to delay her eventual destruction of the world.

title: Dwarrowfolk
=====
Though colloquially known as _dwarves_ and _gnomes,_ the folk who dwell beneath the mountains surrounding the Lissen valley refer to themselves as Dwarrows (and indeed do not recognise themselves as two races, but a single people).

Devoted to both the scholarly and the martial arts, a Dwarrow sees both as being fundamentally necessary to oneâ€™s character. They see little distinction between the craft of metallurgy, the pursuit of knowledge, and the mastery of combat: all are different aspects of the wider worship of [[Esgromond]].

Most Dwarrows prefer to remain under the mountains, but a few work as merchants or even bards on the surface-world. Most are not trusted by regular werrenfolk, but are tolerated, and their wares are highly prized.

title: Pangar and Calanta
=====
Known as _the Lovers,_ Pangar and Calanta are the two moons which appear in the night sky, demigods typically worshipped together.

The larger, blue-grey moon is Pangar, the blacksmith. He is patron of the forge, of [[months]], and of werewolves. His cycle dictates the months, with 28 days between each full moon.

The smaller, reddish moon is Calanta, the [[Maker of the Flame]]. She is patron of fires, of love, and of the home. Her cycle is shorter than that of Pangar, with 12 days between each full moon. Calanta is the daughter of Tarion (the son of Tarn) and Carrow.

Pangar and Calanta had two daughters, [[Rith]] and [[Lillen]], often worshipped as lesser gods, where they govern weddings and family.

And he forged them a blade, by the light of the moons,  
Whose power did wax and did wane:  
For no matter the distance which severed the two,  
Their love would unite them again.

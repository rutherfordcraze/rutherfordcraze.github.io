Most folk of Lissenire speak **Common,** which is written in the Common Script.

[[Dwarrowfolk]] speak both **Dwarrow** (the language of everyday speech and of poetry) and **Gnomic** (the language of academia and sciences). Both are written in Dwarrow runes.

**Old Dwarrow** is the common ancestor of both the Dwarrow and Gnomic tongues, though it is scarcely intelligible to their modern speakers. It is written in Old Dwarrow runes, which are more similar to their later counterpart.

The elves speak **Elven,** a strange tongue which has no written form. (It can be approximated in the Common Script, but the elves consider this distasteful.)

Goblins, hobgoblins and troll-kin speak **Trolk,** which is written using Trolk marks. It is considered easy to learn, but hard to pronounce.

**Stout Common** is a dialect originally spoken by halflings, but now most often used around the lower wards of Bridge Town. It is written in the Common Script, but since it has broad phonetic variation and no standard spelling rules, is not always easy to read.

**Druidic** is a language only for lack of a better term. A way of listening to the natural world rather than communicating with it, druidic takes years of practice and multiple simultaneous speakers to actually speak even a simple word or two. It is written in the Druidic script.

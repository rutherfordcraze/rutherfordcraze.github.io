title: Emerald Guard
=====
The tale goes that, after [[Oser I]] slew [[Gaur Grummore]] and drove back the Medhars, he promised the people of his new empire that they would never again see subjugation. Rather than enslaving or putting to death his captives and prisoners of war, he vowed to show them kindness, and to use their experience for good: the last Medhars became noble protectors of the royal court, a well-trained (and later fiercely loyal) cadre of knights sworn to protect the king and his allies.

Their green skin was called emerald, and they were revered as living proof both that Oserion was good, and that evil was in the deeds of rulers, not in the nature of men — not even Orcs.

The emerald bloodline still remains true. Under the Chaplain–Commander, [[Laurus Candlekin]], the Emerald Guard serve as protectors of the realm and of the king.

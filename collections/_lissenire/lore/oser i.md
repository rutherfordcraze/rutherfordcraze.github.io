title: Oser I
=====
King Oser the Peacebringer, First of his Name, was the first ruler of the [[Oserian Empire]]. Originally a labourer under the yoke of the [[Medhar Chiefdom]], he led a rebellion to slay the leader of the Medhar rule, and drive back the occupying force from the Lissenland.

The line of Oser’s heirs, each of whom carried the heiral title [[Oserion]], lasted until the end of the [[Age of Banners]], though his descendants still rule Lissenire via the House of Merlus.

“Well then give me a horse and a hand-axe with haste  
I will get you the gullet of [[Gaur Grummore]]  
As soon as the sun starts to climb we’ll give chase  
To chop off the head of the chief”  
  
No sooner had Oser this promise set forth  
Than the wail of a war-horn was heard on the wind  
At the crest of the hill, a green knight on a horse  
And an army behind him of sin  
  
“The orc-foe is here, every man to his post!”  
How the cry carried over the camp of the king!  
The thumping of hooves bellowed deep in the earth  
As the swords of the Medhars did sing  
[...]

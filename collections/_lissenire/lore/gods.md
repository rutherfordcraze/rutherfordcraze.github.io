Broadly, the True Gods are divided into two houses: the Sinister, descendants of Waith and Averan; and the Dexter, descendants of Sava and Yrai. While it would be easy to group these as ‘good’ and ‘evil’, they are considered necessary parts of the same whole. _“The bed is softer when the day is long.”_

Worshipping the Sinister Gods (or praying for their blessing) is considered normal in most cases, and part of everyday life for those who venture into their domain. Hunters often keep a shrine to both Tarn and Averan, praying both that their hunt is successful and that the beasts they are hunting proliferate.

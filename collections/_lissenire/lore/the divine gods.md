title: The Divine Gods
=====
The Four Gods, or the Divine Gods, are **[[Muen]],** the Creator; **[[Averan]],** the Disruptor; **[[Sava]],** the Protector; and **[[Tarn]],** the Scholar (or the Hunter). Collectively, they form the Chapel of the Four, the church of [[Oserion]].

There is no specific aspect separating the Four from the innumerable house-gods and world-gods, except that they are considered patrons of the everyday people of Lissenire. Many worship house-gods privately, and the worship of world-gods is generally considered acceptable (depending on the god).

Clerics are most often devotees of one of the Four Gods (though in theory they could be devotees of any). ‘Evil’ clerics are typically aligned with either the chaotic Averan, or with the more literally malign [[Riec D’nar]].

## The Myth of the Four
Muen ruled over a land in perfect order, entirely of his creation; each leaf and creature made by him. Averan asked to be taught the ways of this creation, but secretly, he gave his creations the power to reproduce.

As forests took over Muen’s land, the elder god ordered Sava to scatter Averan’s ashes across all the world — she did, but instead of the ashes of his body, as Muen had intended, she scattered ashes from his fireplace. These ashes became the source of profane magic.

On seeing this, Muen forgave Averan, realising Averan’s creations were just as great as his own; but as punishment for Sava’s lesser betrayal, commanded her firstborn daughter, Tarn, spend all of eternity hunting in Averan’s woods to keep the chaos in check.

title: The Divide
=====
The Divide is a gap between our world and others: [[The Deep Woods]] and [[The Cold World]] lie on the other side. Though often strong, and normally impossible to cross, at times the Divide grows weak and thin enough to be crossed.

Even the greatest sages among the [[Dwarrowfolk]] do not know how to cross the Divide with intent. It can be crossed, but seemingly only by mistake or without knowing it.

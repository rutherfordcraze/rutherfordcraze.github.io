title: Lissenire (Country)
=====
Lissenire, or more formally _Lissenire and the Hinterlands_ (a term which reflects the crown’s claim over the surrounding wildwoods), is the country surrounding the fertile River Lissen, from its watershed in the Great Mountains to its mouth at the sea. While most of Lissenire’s population live near the river, many remain near its borders, where military encampments and fortifications have long tried to keep out the hostile elves and other denizens of [[The Deep Woods]].

The capital of Lissenire, and its largest city, is [[Bridge Town]], near the geographic centre of the region. Upriver is [[Highwater]], by the small waterfall representing the farthest ocean-navigable point on the river. On the edge of the trolldowns in the southwest is Lisenire’s third largest settlement, [[All’s]].

The inhabited part of Lissenire is divided into four counties: [[Nearflet]], [[Pellamstead]], [[Elmenore]] and [[Carrow]]. These are ruled by [[The Four Lords]], and together with the independent Bridge Town make up the lands of the crown.

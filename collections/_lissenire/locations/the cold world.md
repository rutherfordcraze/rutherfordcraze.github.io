title: The Cold World
=====
> It is not empty; it is emptiness itself. And yet it is full of horrors.

Like [[The Deep Woods]], the Cold World is a place parallel to our own existence, and one which cannot be entered on purpose. It is an echo of real life, without plants or the warmth of the sun, nor the grace of [[Pangar and Calanta]] in the sky.

The Cold World is inhabited by spirits who are banished there, some of which appear to be able to see into and interact with the real world. But those who have travelled there and returned speak of other, far more terrible denizens yet to be described.

Crossings into the Cold World coincide with despair: grief, rage, loss and death. Those caught on battlefields or the sites of massacres often report slipping through [[the Divide]] and into the Cold World unintentionally.

It is believed that what the [[Dwarrowfolk]] know as the _Hollow Deep_ is in fact an underground region of the Cold World. Dwarrows always travel in pairs, with bright lights, alcohol, and walking-songs, to avoid any chance of a crossing.

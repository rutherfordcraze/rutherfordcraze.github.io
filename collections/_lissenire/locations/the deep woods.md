title: The Deep Woods
=====
> Those who seek the Deep Woods find only trees.

At ruins or the crossings of leylines; at solstices or twilight; in between-places and between-times, [[the divide]] between our world and the Deep Woods grows most thin. Like [[the Cold World]], a traveller lost or unawares may find themselves crossing into the other realm without even knowing it.

The domain of the Fey is known as the Deep Woods, a world running parallel to our own. Though a traveller entering this place may not even realise it at first, upon closer investigation it seems to follow rules entirely of its own: things do not always disappear over the horizon; rain does not always fall in the same direction.

The Deep Woods are inhabited by many creatures, fey or foul. Occasionally they are able to cross into the true world, and seemingly many can traverse the veil between places freely and at will.

title: King Pellam’s Drown
=====
Just over 200 years ago, a great flood swept down from the Lissen’s wellspring in the mountains above Mull Galudden. Though the precise events preceding and succeeding it are unclear, it is generally understood that the _Drown_ was a last-ditch effort by Pellam, Last King of Oserion, to force back the encroaching wilderness. While it tamed the valley for a time, it claimed his life and many others.

To what extent the flood was natural or profane is not known, but a number of Pellam’s mages were present at the wellspring. Since the flood originated in a sacred cave which, when it flooded, killed all those within it, the theorised ritual that took place is cloaked in mystery.

The flood is commonly accepted to have marked the end of the Age of Banners and the [[Oserion]] bloodline, and dates after the year in which it occurred are considered to be part of the Fourth Era. It took somewhere around a week for the floodwaters to recede enough to begin reclaiming the valley, and by 4E 20 (3E 862) most pre-flood settlements were reoccupied.

<em>
Here comes the sound of the rivulets heralding  
Further and faster flood-waters to come  
Here comes the gentle click–drip of a trickling,  
Onward through mountainsides, beckoning, billowing  
Down through the valleys and willowmires, quickening  
Carving a path for its children to run.  
  
Watch as the trickle gives way to a waterfall:  
Forests and boulders displaced by the flood  
Here comes a wave with the eyes of an animal  
White water rushing from wellspring to ocean-pool  
Drenching the valleys in river-rage terrible  
Churning the pastures and meadows to mud.  
  
This is the flood of King Pellam Oserion:  
Last of his line, at the end of his age.  
This was his gift, both a great and a mortal one;  
This was his sacrifice and his oblivion:  
These were his mages all chanting in unison  
Stirring the water awake with their rage.  
  
This is the purging of monsters from Lissenire  
Clearing the forests and washing away  
Fey-fiend and troll-kin and night-beast and vampire  
Drowned in the water to burn in the gods fire  
Clean-swept the valley, and drowned is the willowmire  
Now is it night, that tomorrow is day.

title: Age of Banners
=====
The Age of Banners was the era during which the [[Oserian Empire]] ruled [Lissenire and the Hinterlands.](./lissenire-country.html) It began with the defeat of the [[Medhar Chiefdom]] in 2E 1519, and ended in 3E 841 with [[King Pellam’s Drown]].

Most everyday folk regard the Third Era and the Age of Banners to have been one and the same, with the Third Era drawing to a close at the time of the flood. However, there are those who believe that the Fourth Era has not yet started — to them, the current year, 4E 204, is in fact 3E 1045.

The royal court considers the current era to be the Second Age of Banners, and the House of [Merlus](./brenin-merlus.html) is a continuation in all but name of the [[Oserion]] line.

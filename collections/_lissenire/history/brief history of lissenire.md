title: A Brief History of Lissenire
=====
## 4E 1–204: **The Fourth Age** (Present Day)
A new empire, led by the house of Merlus, descendants of King Pellam [[Oserion]]; but a weak one, already struggling against the encroaching wilds.

## 3E 1–841: **The Age of Banners** (841 Years)
The rising [[Oserian Empire]] routed the Medhars by slaying their chief, [[Gaur Grummore]], eventually reclaiming the entire valley. Castles and cities were built, and the [[Emerald Guard]] was made from the last of the Medhar chiefs.

## 2E 1427–1519: **The Orcish Rule** (92 Years)
The [[Medhar Chiefdom]] of orcs, riding from the South, conquer the Lissenland and subjugate or destroy the Lei Mara. Though absolute, their power was overstretched, and the chiefdom was eventually driven back by the newly-crowned King [[Oser I]].

## 2E 1–1427: **The Age of Paper** (1427 Years)
The [[Lei Mara]], or Paper-Makers, marched from the East and claimed the Lissen Valley; their sages created great artefacts under the guidance of the [[Dwarrowfolk]]; there was a tenuous peace.

## 1E ?: **The Ruin of Man** (~50 Years)
The Age of Metal ended, though no record shows exactly how. Some say a great cataclysm; others merely a slow petering out.

## 1E 1–5000?: **The Age of Metal** (~5000 Years)
Men were born, and given free will, and began to shape metal and wage war and fell trees. The Deep Woods were fought back for the first time, and became lost to all but the elves.

## 0E ?: **The Making of the World**
In which [[Muen]] poured the sea and sculpted the land, and the Gods were mighty.

title: Oserian Empire
=====
The Oserian Empire (or _Empire Oserion_) was the domain of the [descendants of Oser I](oserion.html), as it stood during the Age of Banners.

The founding of the Empire is regarded as having coincided with the slaying of [[Gaur Grummore]] by king [[Oser I]], and the driving back of the Medhars from the [[Lissenire]] valley; its fall (or its transformation into the Kingdom of Lissenire, depending on interpretation) was [[King Pellamâ€™s Drown]], the great flood in 3E 841.

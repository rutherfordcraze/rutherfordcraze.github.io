title: Medhar Chiefdom
=====
The Medhar Chiefdom was an occupying empire of Orcish horse-lords, which ruled Lissenire and the Hinterlands during the latter part of the Second Era. Riding from the South, and with a tacit allegiance with the Elves, they swiftly conquered the Lissenland up to the northern edge of what is now the county of [[Nearflet]].

Though their rule was savage and absolute, they could not hold back both the border woods and the people of Lissenire permanently. After the Elves began raiding the supply caravans from their parent nation, the now-legendary defeat of their chief [[Gaur Grummore]] at the hands of [[Oser I]] in 2E 1519 routed the Medhar armies, and drove them back from the valley.

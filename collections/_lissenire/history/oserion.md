title: Oserion

(This page refers to the Oserian bloodline. For the empire over which the _Kings Oserion_ ruled, see [[Oserian Empire]].)

_Oserion_ (lit. ‘Descendant of [[Oser]]’) was an heiral name bestowed upon rightful rulers of the [[Oserian Empire]] by their predecessors. The first to bear the name was Alor I Oserion, son of [[Oser I]]; the last was [[Pellam]] Oserion, no heir of whom survived.

After [[King Pellam’s Drown]] effectively ended the bloodline, the next heir to the throne was Peldred Merlus, nephew of Pellam; he became the rightful king with little dispute, but did not bear the Oserion title.

# The Road to Druidstone
> <em>Two hundred years of peace are drawing to an end. After the great flood, there was a time when the lands around the Lissen River were calm and relatively safe. But now the days are growing darker, and the nights are drawing in. In the dark corners of the world, the wilderness grows stronger, and things which were sleeping have begun to stir.

Beorn walked down the muddy track towards Druidstone, in answer to a letter from Emond (and another from Brother Lowen). As he passed the Morrow Ford, he ran into Kladi, who by coincidence was walking the same way at the same time.

There was some awkward conversation as they greeted each other, but they did not speak much. Beorn seemed less sociable than Kladi.

As the land flattened out along the side of the Gullwash river, they encountered a merchant standing by his handcart. He asked them for help, saying that a “slimy bastard” had stolen his coinpurse and a pewter jug, then disappeared between two spokes of his cart wheel.

Beorn walked straight past the man. Kladi seemed willing to help, but demanded payment upfront — the merchant reluctantly offered a sheepskin rug from his collection of wares, and Kladi promised to look for the thief.

Catching up to Beorn, with no intention of helping the merchant, Kladi continued along the road, dropping a handful of seeds behind him (which Beorn noticed, but ignored). As they were a hundred metres or so from the merchant, Beorn felt a tug at his ankle and tripped over, but dusted himself off and continued.

During the walk to Druidstone, Kladi tried begging passers-by for money (unsuccessfully). Beorn gave him a stern lecture on materialism, which he dismissed as ‘something a follower of Tarn _would_ say.’

Arriving in Druidstone at sunset, the two welkin-men headed for the inn, where they met Bethlen. Each asked for a flagon of water, and a room for the night — Beorn agreed to pay five silver pieces for the small room, but Kladi mentioned that he had come in response to Emond’s letter, and was given free lodgings in the large room at the front of the inn.

Kladi attempted to strike up a conversation with two commoners — a father and son — at the table by the door, saying he was a priest of Averan. The son did not acknowledge him, and the father told him they were worshippers of Tarn, and that he should leave.

Beorn approached the same men and asked where the chapel of Tarn was, and they patronisingly directed him to the big church across the way. He left the inn, reading his prayer-book outside.

Kladi approached Bethlen, who explained that the locals are distrusting of strangers, and on edge after recent events — seeing things by the river, and strange lights in the sky. She also mentioned that Emond was away, but would be at the inn tomorrow morning for a council, as it was the last day of Barleywine.

After a brief conversation outside (during which Beorn agreed to help Kladi deal with Emond’s problem), they headed, one at a time, to their rooms. Kladi prayed, and they each went to sleep.

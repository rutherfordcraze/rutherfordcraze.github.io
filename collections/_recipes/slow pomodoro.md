title: Slow Pomodoro
---
Not quick, but much simpler than the length of this recipe implies. It takes all day and I think it’s 100% worth it.

## Ingredients

- 1 large white onion
- 6–10 large, ripe tomatoes (or more, if you want more sauce)
- Good olive oil
- Salt (flaky/kosher salt is easier to work with)

Optional:
- A dash of wine (red for a richer flavour, or white for more brightness)
- 1 clove garlic, peeled & crushed
- A tablespoon or so of mayo (vegan mayo actually works better)
- A few basil leaves
- Parmesan (or grana padano), shaved or grated
- Fresh chillis or a pinch of chilli flakes

## Prep

- Cross the skin of the tomatoes with a sharp knife, then blanch in boiling water until the skin begins to loosen. Drop into ice-cold water to finish the process.

- Peel the blanched tomatoes and reserve the skins to one side. Roughly dice the peeled tomatoes (you may want to cut away the tough, green-white part at the top, if it looks particularly big).

- Add the chopped tomatoes to a large bowl and add a generous amount of salt all over (slightly more than you think is needed — salt both breaks down the flesh of the tomatoes and enhances the flavours, so don’t be afraid to add a lot). Add a dash of wine if you want, and leave everything to stand and combine.

- Take a large, high-sided pan with a flat base (a sauté is perfect, but any big saucepan will do), and cover the base with good olive oil — about 5–10mm deep, depending on the width of the pan.

- Over a low–medium heat, wait for the oil to come to temperature and then add the reserved tomato skins, carefully enough that they can cook without touching each other much (you might need to do 2 batches). The goal here is to infuse the oil with fat-soluble flavours in the skins, not to fry them — they should be lightly bubbling, but not spitting.

- After a few minutes, the skins should go semi-transparent, and the oil will become increasingly orange and aromatic. Remove the skins (making sure not to remove too much oil with them) and keep them to one side.

- Dice the onion (medium to fine, depending on how smooth you want the overall texture of the sauce) and add it to the oil. Cook slowly for 10 minutes or so, until it softens, and stir to avoid any browning.

- Optional, but recommended: add the caramelised skins to a blender, along with the crushed garlic clove, basil, parmesan, chillis, and anything else you think might taste good. Add the mayo (this is for consistency more than taste) and just enough olive oil to make it blend into a thick sauce. You can add some of this sauce back to the main recipe at the end, but it’s also an incredible ingredient in other recipes. If you leave it overnight (in the fridge), the kick from the garlic will mellow out, at which point it’s the perfect dip for a grilled cheese sandwich.

## Reduction

- Once the onion has softened, add the diced tomatoes and stir together. You might feel the impulse to turn the heat up, but don’t go above a medium heat at any point — if the sugars in the tomatoes get hot enough to caramelise, the flavour development will stop. As the sauce cooks, you’ll need to reduce the heat further as the volume of liquid in the pan goes down.

- Put on a movie or something. Pull up a chair. Keep stirring the sauce gently, knocking back any residue that starts forming on the sides of the pan, for the next... 2 hours? As long as it takes. The tomatoes will break down and incorporate, and after about 90 minutes the flavours will start to become exponentially richer and more intense. Keep checking the heat; you want nothing above a gentle simmer. Taste the sauce intermittently to check how the flavours are developing.

- You’ll be able to tell when the flavours are ready, but they keep getting stronger the longer you wait. Keep simmering gently until the sauce is just a tiny bit thicker than you want it to be — at that point, you can take it off the heat and serve. If you made the ‘booster’ sauce from the caramelised skins, you can add some back to the main reduction (to taste) at this point.

- Serve with a good pasta — the shape does matter to _some_ extent, since the sauce won’t stick to something too smooth. Farfalle works great; anything _rigate_ (‘ridged’) should be fine. If you want something more like spaghetti or linguine, try to find bronze die-cut pasta, which has a rougher surface that the sauce can stick to better.

- Any leftover sauce can be kept in the fridge for a few days, or frozen. If you use vegan mayo, the only non-vegan ingredient is the parmesan, which you can simply leave out.

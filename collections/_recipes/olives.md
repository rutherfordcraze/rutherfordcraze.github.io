title: Really Good Olives
---
(Very) approximately based on a recipe I (drunkenly) attempted to commit to memory while talking to the chef at my favourite restaurant. My olives are not as outstandingly, transcendentally delicious as their olives, but are still really good.

## Ingredients

- ~500g olives (a mix of black and green is best)
- Juice of half an orange
- 3–6 cloves of [confit garlic](./confit-garlic)
- A good-size splash of rice vinegar
- 1–2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- Pinch of cumin
- 1–2 tbsp olive oil (ideally the oil from the garlic)

## Method

1. Combine the ingredients. Adjust quantities to taste.

2. Wait. (They’re better after marinating, at least overnight.)

title: Potato Salad
---
For many years, I thought potato salad was boring. It turns out if you add _things with strong flavours_ then it’s great.

This recipe skips quantities because it basically all depends on your preferences and how many potatoes you have. The potatoes provide texture and a bit of umami, but really they’re a vehicle for that wonderful acidity. The cream, pickles, mustard and sorrel all contribute different notes to the same harmony.

## Ingredients

- A bunch of (new) potatoes
- Celery
- Carrot
- Sour cream
- (Vegan) mayo*
- Sour pickles
- Mustard
- A couple of sorrel leaves
- Herbs/spices to taste

*You can use regular mayo, but I genuinely think vegan mayo is better. More fresh and lemony, less egg/vinegar.

## Method

1. Roughly dice and then boil the potatoes. (Start them in cold water for more even cooking.)

2. Drain the potatoes and leave to cool _all the way down._ In the meantime, finely mince celery, pickles and carrot in a roughly 1:1:1 ratio (or just grate the carrot, it’s much quicker).

3. Combine an appropriate quantity of sour cream and mayo (in a roughly 2:1 ratio), and add as much mustard as you can possibly get away with.

4. Shred the sorrel leaves, and any other herbs. I use fresh thyme, and tender sage leaves from the garden.

5. Combine everything — gently, you’re not trying to mash the potatoes — and season with black pepper (and a bit of salt, if needed).

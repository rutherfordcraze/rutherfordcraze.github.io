title: Confit Garlic
---
## Ingredients

- 3–5 heads of garlic (yes, _heads,_ not cloves)
- Oil (I use a mix of olive and sunflower oil)

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 120°C.

2. Peel the garlic and place the cloves in an ovenproof pan. Add olive oil until they’re just submerged (it helps to use a smaller pan for a higher garlic-to-oil ratio).

3. Cover and place in the oven for 2 hours.

4. That’s it. Leave to cool and keep refrigerated.

Before refrigeration, confiting was common as a food preservation method, and this confit garlic will last 2 weeks in the fridge or longer in the freezer. _However,_ because this provides a mild-pH, low-oxygen environment, there is a non-zero risk of the pathogen which causes botulism. Practice good food hygiene.

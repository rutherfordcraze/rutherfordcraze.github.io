title: Gnocchi Thing
---
## Ingredients

- 1 white onion, finely diced
- 2–4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or minced
- 1 tin chopped or peeled tomatoes
- 1 thing of gnocchi (about 4 portions’ worth)
- 100ml white wine
- 1–2 tbsp tomato purée
- Sundried (or half-sundried, if possible) tomatoes in oil
- A handful of basil leaves
- A couple of sage leaves

## Method

1. Drain the sundried tomatoes and use the tomato-infused oil to fry the onion in a sautée pan until it’s mostly softened.

2. Add the garlic and stir for a few moments to prevent browning before stirring in the tomato purée (along with a stock cube, if you want an extra flavour boost).

3. Once the purée is starting to stick to the pan, but before it burns, deglaze with the wine. Simmer for a few seconds before tipping in the tomatoes and sage leaves.

4. Add the gnocchi (you can cook down the tomatoes for a bit first, but it’s not vital) and just enough water to cover.

5. Stir every so often for a few minutes, until the gnocchi is almost cooked, then remove the sage leaves (unless you really like sage) and add the basil.

6. Remove from the heat and combine until the basil leaves start to wilt. Serve with feta or whatever else seems appropriate.

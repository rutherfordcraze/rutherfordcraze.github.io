title: Worcestershire Sauce
---
Authentically, Worcestershire sauce is made with fermented anchovies; this version tastes similar (I think a little better, since it’s less vinegar-forward), but it’s also vegan.

This recipe makes about a litre, which will probably last you about a decade. Since it’s mostly vinegar, it should keep for about the same length of time.

## Ingredients

- 1kg plums, stones removed
- 500ml malt vinegar
- 250ml white wine vinegar
- 30–50ml light soy sauce
- 230ml black treacle
- 100g brown sugar
- A finely chopped jalapeño
- 3–4 cloves garlic
- A thumb-sized bit of ginger
- 1/2 tsp each of ground allspice, cloves, nutmeg, black pepper, and turmeric

## Method

1. Add everything to a big saucepan.

2. Simmer for about an hour, until the plums have mostly broken down.

3. Strain through a coarse seive (you might need to push it through in batches with a spoon).

4. Bottle and use.

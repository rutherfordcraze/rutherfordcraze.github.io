# An exploration of reduction and scale in type design (2019–20)

MD Eight is an unconventional type family, consisting of an 8×8 pixel font, along with six display styles — built on the same structure, but designed for reproduction at large sizes. All seven styles feature swash caps, for some reason.

As part of the release marketing for this typeface, I created an interactive text adventure game, [The Cave of Dolmenlore](./dolmenlore).

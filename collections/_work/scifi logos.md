# Logos for sci-fi corporations (2020)

Logotypes & marks set in my own typefaces â€” mostly [MD System](./md-system), also [MD Eight](./md-eight), [Greymarch](./greymarch). No client, just warm-up sketches. Inspired by the work of [Bao T Nguyen](https://baotnguyen.com) and [TDR](https://www.thedesignersrepublic.com).

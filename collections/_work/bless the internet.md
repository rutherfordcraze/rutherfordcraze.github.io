# Lettering & type details for a single by [Base](https://www.instagram.com/basetheone/) (2021)

Based on my earlier typeface [Chasmata](./chasmata), with extensive modifications. With permission from the artist, I hid the 9×4 rectangular [Mass-Driver](https://mass-driver.com) logomark in the negative space on the first line.

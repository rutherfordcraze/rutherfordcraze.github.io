# An experimental variable font with extreme width contrast (2018)

The original brief for this typeface was to create ‘the logo for a sci-fi dystopian megacorporation’. The concept was subsequently expanded to become a variable font, with a single weight/width axis.

This design was used in the cartridge art for _Nominal,_ my 2018 [Famicase](./famicase) entry.

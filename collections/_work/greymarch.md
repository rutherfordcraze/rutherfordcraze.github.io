# A workhorse serif typeface for editorial design (2019)

The final project for my MA studies at [TypeMedia](https://typemedia.org). _Greymarch_ is a serif based on humanist calligraphy, modernised and adapted to work in a print/editorial design context. I created eight styles (four interpolated), with an extended latin character set and small caps.

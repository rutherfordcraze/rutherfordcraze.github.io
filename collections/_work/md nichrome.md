# A typeface based on sci-fi paperback covers from the 1970s (2020–21)

Originally released as two styles via [Future Fonts](https://www.futurefonts.xyz) in April 2020; subsequently expanded and published in August 2021 as a family of sixteen styles. Available for licensing at [Mass-Driver](https://mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-nichrome).

MD Nichrome is a spiritual continuation of the research I started for [M74](./m74).

# A reinterpretation of the flaws of early sans-serifs (2020–21)

MD Primer was designed to celebrate the often unrefined, inconsistent nature of grotesque typefaces from the late 19th century. Related to my work on [MD System](./md-system), though designed for a different range of contexts. Updated in 2024 with a full set of italics, designed by my friend and frequent collaborator Luke Charsley.

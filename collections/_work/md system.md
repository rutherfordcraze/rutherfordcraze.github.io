# A typeface for general practice (2019–23)

My first commercial release, MD System is a grotesque typeface based on a number of historical references, and designed for both printed text and screen UI.

In 2023, I expanded the typeface with two additional widths (_Narrow_ and _Condensed_), along with a monospaced version (the design of which was led by Luke Charsley). With 40 styles and over 30,000 glyphs, it’s by far my largest project to date.

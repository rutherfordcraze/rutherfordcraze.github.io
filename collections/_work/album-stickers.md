# Logos, stickers & details for album art (2020)

Related to my earlier [logos for sci-fi corporations](./scifi-logos). These marks were designed to be used for detailing on album artwork, reminiscent of the various label & recording stickers from (particularly) early CD & digital releases.

Used in the cover artwork for [Bless the Internet](./bless-the-internet).

# A typeface based on the unique aesthetic of <abbr title="Magnetic Ink Character Recognition">MICR</abbr> numbers.

MD Polychrome is a display typeface inspired by <abbr>MICR</abbr> (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) numerals from the late â€™50s, as well as the various pre-digital typefaces which sought to emulate the same style.

Available for licensing at [Mass-Driver](https://mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-polychrome). I also built a [specimen website](https://polychrome.mass-driver.com) to showcase the design.
